Reference: [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/999.pdf][PipeMSM: Hardware Acceleration for Multi-Scalar Multiplication]]

- MSM -> Multi-scalar multiplication.
- MSM is a fundamental computational problem.
- Main bottleneck in ZK-SNARKs.
- In PipeMSM, they put forth a pipelined design to compute MSM.
- They claim to have a modular multiplication technique which they deem to be of their independent interest.
